    <h1>Silverlight Beta 0.4</h1>
    <p>This is the fourth beta release of Silverlight and the largest one so far. Note that a lot of new modules are
        experimental and may not work properly. Below are all the
        changes made to the mod menu in this version:</p>

    <h2>Module state saving support is here!</h2>

    <p>The mod menu now has a "Save Module State" button which saves all of the module states. This
        means that if you
        enable a module and then close the game, the module will still be enabled when you decide boot up the game
        again. <b>Be cautious when using this functionality as you may have to reset your save config if you use it
            while a module that crashes in the plaza is enabled since that will cause your game to crash on boot.</b>
    </p>
